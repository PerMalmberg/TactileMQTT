TactileMQTT
===========

# Visualize data/send commands through MQTT. 
* Drag-and-drop editor.
* Runs entierly on the client.
* Modular design allows new widgets, or elements as they are called, to be added without affecting other parts.

* Only tested on Chrome.

Note: This is my first-ever Javascript application, so please be gentle :)
