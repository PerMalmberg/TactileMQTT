TactileMQTT
===========

# Visualize data/send commands through MQTT. 
* Drag-and-drop editor.
* Runs entierly on the client.
* Modular design allows new widgets, or elements as they are called, to be added without affecting other parts.
* Long press/touch enables/disables the edit mode.

* Only tested on Chrome.
* Better separation between backend and UI-logic needed. Would be cool if there were something like WPF-bindings available to enable such separation.

Note: This is my first-ever Javascript application, so please be gentle :)
